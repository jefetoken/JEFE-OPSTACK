# Knuckles Blockchain

## Introduction

**Knuckles** is the next evolution of the Jefe Token ecosystem, built on the Optimism stack. This blockchain is designed to enhance scalability, security, and efficiency for the Jefe community and beyond.

## Why Knuckles is Built on the Optimism Stack

### Scalability
- **Optimism Stack**: Optimism is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, enabling up to 2,000 transactions per second. This significantly increases throughput, ensuring smooth operations during peak times.

### Cost Efficiency
- **Lower Transaction Fees**: Transactions on the Optimism network are considerably cheaper than on Layer 1 Ethereum. This cost efficiency benefits all users, making interactions with the Knuckles Blockchain more affordable.

### Compatibility
- **Ethereum Interoperability**: Optimism maintains full compatibility with Ethereum, ensuring seamless interoperability with existing Ethereum-based applications and smart contracts.

### Security
- **Optimistic Rollups**: Optimism uses optimistic rollups, processing transactions off-chain and then submitting them to Ethereum. This ensures that Knuckles remains secure while being scalable.

## Open Source Philosophy

### Transparency
- **Open Development**: By being open source, the development of Knuckles is transparent. The community can see, contribute to, and audit the codebase, ensuring the blockchain operates with integrity and trust.

### Collaboration
- **Community Contributions**: Open sourcing allows developers worldwide to contribute to the Knuckles project. This fosters innovation, as a diverse group of contributors can bring in new ideas and solutions.

### Innovation
- **Shared Knowledge**: Open source projects benefit from the collective knowledge of the global developer community. Knuckles leverages the latest advancements in blockchain technology and contributes back to the ecosystem.

### Flexibility
- **Customization and Adaptation**: Open source code can be customized and adapted to meet the specific needs of the Jefe community. This flexibility ensures that Knuckles can continuously improve and adapt to new challenges and opportunities.

## Roadmap: Knuckles

1. **Integration of Optimism Stack**
   - Integrate Optimism technology stack to enhance scalability and transaction efficiency.

2. **Deployment of Knuckles Blockchain Testnet**
   - Launch the Knuckles Blockchain Testnet for community testing and feedback.

3. **Infrastructure Measurement & Improvement**
   - Assess current infrastructure and make necessary improvements to ensure optimal performance.

4. **Storage in Blockchain Archives of Web3 Activities**
   - Implement storage solutions on-chain and off-chain to archive Web3 activities, ensuring transparency and accessibility.

5. **Optimistic Optimization with Blobs**
   - Implement optimistic optimization techniques using Blobs for data management, enhancing speed and efficiency.

6. **Fault-Proof Engine 1.0.1**
   - Develop and deploy Fault-Proof Engine 1.0.1 to enhance the reliability and stability of the Knuckles Blockchain.

7. **IoT Knuckles Node**
   - Develop specialized Knuckles nodes for IoT devices, expanding the reach and utility of the blockchain.

8. **Open Source Knuckle Sync Optimizer**
   - Release an open-source Knuckle Sync Optimizer tool to facilitate synchronization and optimization processes for developers and users.

9. **Knuckles Mainnet Deployment**
   - Launch the Knuckles Mainnet, marking the official release of the Knuckles Blockchain for widespread adoption and use.
